# Club Logos Instructions

The 150 folder contains images that were retrieved from the respective club websites. The 25 folder is all of the same logos scaled down to be combined in a sprite.

The website we use to generate a new sprite is www.toptal.com/developers/css/sprite-generator/

**Settings:**

* Set the padding to 0px
* Set the element alignment to **top-down**

You can then download the new sprite and map the logo CSS to the appropriate club entries in `fcdallas.css`.
